This Python script asks the user for the known variables (voltage, current, or resistance), then solves for the other unknown variable. 
Ranges from 0 to selected value are made. A plot of current vs voltage is displayed. The slope is resistance.
If it is linear, then it is from an Ohmic device.
If it is nonlinear, then it is from a non-Ohmic device.
